In this code, we first define two helper functions to convert degrees to radians and vice versa. We then define a function `calculate_julian_date` to calculate the Julian date based on the current year, month, and day. 

Next, we define the `calculate_sunrise_sunset` function to calculate the time of sunrise and sunset based on the Julian date, latitude, longitude, altitude, and zenith angle. This function uses several mathematical formulas and the calculations are based on the method described in the book "Astronomical Algorithms" by Jean Meeus.

In the `main` function, we first use the `localtime` function from the `time.h` library to get the current date and time. We then calculate the Julian date using the `calculate_julian_date` function.

Finally, we calculate the time of each of the five daily prayers using the `calculate_sunrise_sunset` function, with the appropriate latitude, longitude, and zenith angle values for Fes, Morocco. We print out the prayer times using `printf`.

This is a simple implementation of a prayer application in C language, but it should give you an idea of how such an application could be written according to the Ministry of Islamic Affairs.
